The decision made in 2005 to use [Bitkeeper](https://www.bitkeeper.org/documentation.html) for Linux kernel development was a controversial one.

## Look out For New Tools 

### Goals

1. Speed

2. Simple design

3. Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)

4. Fully distributed

5. Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

6. Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.
