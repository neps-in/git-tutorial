# Best Practices

## Small logical commits.

## Always review code before committing it.

Use 
1.  git add --patch To add changes to your staging area.
2.  git diff --cached To review your staging area.

## Use Gitignore files.

## Set Protocol for yourself and Never try to break it.

## If you have mastered an art of Hammer don't see everthingelse as a Nail.

## Use aliases for common Git commands.
