## [Re]moving Files
```
$ git rm [options] <files>

[options]
-f, --force  Override the up-to-date check.

--cached 
Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. 
Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.

-n, --dry-run
Don't actually remove any file(s). Instead, just show if they exist in the index and would otherwise be removed by the command.

-r Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.
